abstract = {Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is one of the most recently introduced swarm-based algorithms. ABC simulates the intelligent foraging behaviour of a honeybee swarm. In this work, ABC is used for optimizing a large set of numerical test functions and the results produced by ABC algorithm are compared with the results obtained by genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization algorithm, differential evolution algorithm and evolution strategies. Results show that the performance of the ABC is better than or similar to those of other population-based algorithms with the advantage of employing fewer control parameters.}

abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter presents a new population-based search algorithm called the Bees Algorithm (BA). This algorithm mimics the food foraging behavior of swarms of honeybees. In its basic version, the algorithm performs a kind of neighborhood search combined with random search and can be used for both combinatorial optimization and functional optimization. This chapter focuses on the latter. Following a description of the algorithm, the chapter presents the results obtained for a number of benchmark problems demonstrating the efficiency and robustness of the new algorithm. The results show that the algorithm can reliably handle complex multi-model optimization problems without being trapped at local solutions. One of the drawbacks of the algorithm is the number of tunable parameters used. However, it is possible to set the parameter values by conducting a small number of trials.}
