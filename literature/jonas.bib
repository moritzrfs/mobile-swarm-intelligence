In this work, ABC is used for optimizing a large set of numerical test functions and the results produced by ABC algorithm are compared with the results obtained by genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization algorithm, differential evolution algorithm and evolution strategies. Results show that the performance of the ABC is better than or similar to those of other population-based algorithms with the advantage of employing fewer control parameters.}

abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter presents a new population-based search algorithm called the Bees Algorithm (BA). This algorithm mimics the food foraging behavior of swarms of honeybees. In its basic version, the algorithm performs a kind of neighborhood search combined with random search and can be used for both combinatorial optimization and functional optimization. This chapter focuses on the latter. Following a description of the algorithm, the chapter presents the results obtained for a number of benchmark problems demonstrating the efficiency and robustness of the new algorithm. The results show that the algorithm can reliably handle complex multi-model optimization problems without being trapped at local solutions. One of the drawbacks of the algorithm is the number of tunable parameters used. However, it is possible to set the parameter values by conducting a small number of trials.}

abstract = {Ant System, the first Ant Colony Optimization algorithm, showed to be a viable method for attacking hard combinatorial optimization problems. Yet, its performance, when compared to more fine-tuned algorithms, was rather poor for large instances of traditional benchmark problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem. To show that Ant Colony Optimization algorithms could be good alternatives to existing algorithms for hard combinatorial optimization problems, recent research in this area has mainly focused on the development of algorithmic variants which achieve better performance than Ant System. In this paper, we present MAX–MIN Ant System (MMAS), an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm derived from Ant System. MMAS differs from Ant System in several important aspects, whose usefulness we demonstrate by means of an experimental study. Additionally, we relate one of the characteristics specific to MMAS — that of using a greedier search than Ant System — to results from the search space analysis of the combinatorial optimization problems attacked in this paper. Our computational results on the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Quadratic Assignment Problem show that MMAS is currently among the best performing algorithms for these problems.}
